* Unit test for bit input/output functions
* Possibly switch to closed intervals for coder range: (lower, upper). 
  Currently it is [lower, upper). But it looks like math is simplier with
  intervals open on the right (current implimentation). But everybody else
  use closed intervals (and also have slightly different interpretation of
  interval mapping process).
* Introduce (maybe optional) optimization with trailing zeros
  When decoder runs out of input it will emit zeros. So it's possible to
  remove all trailing zeros from the encoder outputs. The same thing could be
  done for 1s, but decoder will need to emit 1s when it runs out of input.
